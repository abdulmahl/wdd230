                    food trucks that cover the coastal area from Los Angeles to San Diego. 
                    The company sells fruits and produce directly from the farmers in the area, 
                    but also uses some national and international suppliers. The owner-operated
                    company caters to walk in traffic at their storefront in Carlsbad and, 
                    of course, their food trucks.
                    They deliver and manage those orders on the 
                    phone and via the website. The mission is to provide fresh and healthy foods
                    options, including organic, made to order, fruit drinks and fruit bags, to the 
                    local population and to tourists visiting the coastal areas. The theme should 
                    support healthy eating, organic bounty, and convenience.
