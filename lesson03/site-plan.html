      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hey there! My name is M.Abdul Mahlangu and I'm a web and computer programming student at Brigham Young University-Idaho through (BYU Pathway Worldwide). I'm currently looking for an internship in any of these fields, web frontend developer, junior JavaScript developer, or junior programmer. The ideal internship would be related to my major (Applied Technology), but if it's not related to my major, that's fine too! I'm looking for an internship that will allow me to work with a company or individual that has a website or other software applications. You can check out some of my projects on https://abdulmahl.github.io/wdd230/.</p>  <!-- change this -->
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <h3>I love to create content that's relatable and engaging, but also informative! </h3>
      <p>I have always been fascinated with machines, but I didn't start coding until I was in high school. When I did, it became clear that it is something that interested me, now it has become my passion.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        With the opportunity to learn from a team of experienced developers, I want to learn how to build and create user interfaces for both desktop and mobile using the latest standards and libraries. I want to achieve better knowledge of programming languages, how to write clean, readable code, how the frontend and backend works, and what it means to be a full stack web developer. I want to improve my coding skills and master languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other necessary programming languages to ensure my success.

        I love learning new things, whether it's a new language or a new recipe. I love to talk about my experiences with other people and see their reactions when they hear or see something that I've done. I like to try new things, but I also like to know what works and what doesn't work based on my own experience.
